# SortManager

written by James Philip 13/03/2020

This project has three different sorters: A merge sorter, a bubble sorter and binary tree sorter. 

The user is able to select which sorter they wish to use. The sorted array and the time taken for the selected sort to sort are displayed.

This project was part of a learning process to understand MVC, logging, and the factory design pattern.
